# WC_Mod

## Purpose of script:

Some sites I work on and update use an older version of the Kentico CMS system. This CMS causes issues when
trying to impliment either Bootstrap or other methods of site responsiveness. 

This script modifies certain important DOM elements in a way that allows the user to use the CMS as normal, with zero 
programming experience, and everything will adjust and be reponsive as needed. This includes **footers**, **navigation 
centering**,
and **images**.
